# Purpose

In order to provide a simple portable test environment for Grid Engine, this repo contains what is necessary to build a Ubuntu 12 based image using Docker. In addition, it provides a copy of [`binstar`]( http://binstar-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html ) and [`conda`]( http://conda.pydata.org/ ) with some extensions for building.
